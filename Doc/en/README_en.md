-----------------------------
This is a Micor DAPLink project. This project is developed based on the [STM32F103C8T6_CMSIS-DAP_SW](https://github.com/RadioOperator/STM32F103C8T6_CMSIS-DAP_SWO) project, referring to the source code of [DAPLINK](https://github.com/ARMmbed/DAPLink?tab=readme-ov-file).
The goal of this project is to remove the redundant files in the DAPLink source code in order to achieve a streamlined version of the DAPLink firmware.
